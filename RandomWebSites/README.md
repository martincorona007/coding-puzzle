| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| E8    | Overloading Constructors with Different Data Types               |   | Write a Java program to create a class called Point with instance variables x and y. Implement overloaded constructors: One constructor takes int parameters. Another constructor takes double parameters. Print the values of the variables for each constructor.  |
| E7    | Constructor with Default Values                                |   | Write a Java program to create a class called  Car with instance variables make, model, and year. Implement a parameterized constructor that initializes these variables and assigns default values if not provided. Print the values of the variables.  |
| E6    | Constructor with Validation                                |   | Write a Java program to create a class called Account with instance variables accountNumber and balance. Implement a parameterized constructor that initializes these variables with validation: accountNumber should be non-null and non-empty.balance should be non-negative.Print an error message if the validation fails.  |
| E5    | Copy Constructor                                    |   | Write a Java program to create a class called Rectangle with instance variables length and width. Implement a parameterized constructor and a copy constructor that initializes a new object using the values of an existing object. Print the values of the variables.  |
| E4    | Chaining Constructors                                    |   | Write a Java program to create a class called Student with instance variables studentId, studentName, and grade. Implement a default constructor and a parameterized constructor that takes all three instance variables. Use constructor chaining to initialize the variables. Print the values of the variables. |
| E3    | Constructor Overloading                                    |   |  Write a Java program to create a class called "Book" with instance variables title, author, and price. Implement a default constructor and two parameterized constructors: One constructor takes title and author as parameters. The other constructor takes title, author, and price as parameters. Print the values of the variables for each constructor.  |
| E2    | Parameterized Constructor                                    |   |  Write a Java program to create a class called  Dog with instance variables name and color. Implement a parameterized constructor that takes name and color as parameters and initializes the instance variables. Print the values of the variables.  |
| E1    | Default Constructor                                           |  [Java](https://github.com/martincorona007/coding-puzzle/blob/main/RandomWebSites/WebSite1/E1/Cat.java) |  Write a Java program to create a class called “Cat” with instance variables name and age. Implement a default constructor that initializes the name to "Unknown" and the age to 0. Print the values of the variables.  |
