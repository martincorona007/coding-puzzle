| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| E18    |  Inheritance 8 |   | Write a Java program to create a class called Shape with methods called getPerimeter() and getArea(). Create a subclass called Circle that overrides the getPerimeter() and getArea() methods to calculate the area and perimeter of a circle. |
| E17    |  Inheritance 7 |   | Write a Java program to create a class known as Person with methods called getFirstName() and getLastName(). Create a subclass called Employee that adds a new method named getEmployeeId() and overrides the getLastName() method to include the employee's job title. |
| E16    |  Inheritance 6 |   | Write a Java program to create a class called Animal with a method named move(). Create a subclass called Cheetah that overrides the move() method to run. |
| E15    |  Inheritance 5 |   | Write a Java program to create a class known as "BankAccount" with methods called deposit() and withdraw(). Create a subclass called SavingsAccount that overrides the withdraw() method to prevent withdrawals if the account balance falls below one hundred. |
| E14    |  Inheritance 4 |   | Write a Java program to create a class called Employee with methods called work() and getSalary(). Create a subclass called HRManager that overrides the work() method and adds a new method called addEmployee(). |
| E13    |  Inheritance 3 |   | Write a Java program to create a class called Shape with a method called getArea(). Create a subclass called Rectangle that overrides the getArea() method to calculate the area of a rectangle. |

| E10    |  Constructor for Singleton Pattern |   | Write a Java program to create a class called Singleton that ensures only one instance of the class can be created. Implement a private constructor and a public static method to get the single instance of the class. Print a message indicating the creation of the instance. |
| E9    |  Constructor with Array Initialization |   | Write a Java program to create a class called Classroom with instance variables className and students (an array of strings). Implement a parameterized constructor that initializes these variables. Print the values of the variables. |
| E8    | Overloading Constructors with Different Data Types               |   | Write a Java program to create a class called Point with instance variables x and y.

| E4    | Chaining Constructors                                    |   | Write a Java program to create a class called Student with instance variables studentId, studentName, and grade. Implement a default constructor and a parameterized constructor that takes all three instance variables. Use constructor chaining to initialize the variables. Print the values of the variables. |
| E3    | Constructor Overloading                                    |   |  Write a Java program to create a class called "Book" with instance variables title, author, and price. Implement a default constructor and two parameterized constructors: One constructor takes title and author as parameters. The other constructor takes title, author, and price as parameters. Print the values of the variables for each constructor.  |
| E2    | Parameterized Constructor                                    |   |  Write a Java program to create a class called  Dog with instance variables name and color. Implement a parameterized constructor that takes name and color as parameters and initializes the instance variables. Print the values of the variables.  |
| E1    | Default Constructor                                           |  [Java](https://github.com/martincorona007/coding-puzzle/blob/main/RandomWebSites/WebSite1/E1/Cat.java) |  Write a Java program to create a class called “Cat” with instance variables name and age. Implement a default constructor that initializes the name to "Unknown" and the age to 0. Print the values of the variables.  |
